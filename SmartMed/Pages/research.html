                <p style="text-align: justify;">Hypertension is currently the most frequent clinical cardiovascular disease, affecting more 
                    than 800 million people throughout the world. Reliable sources predict that more than 1.2 
                    billion persons will be diagnosed with hypertension by the year 2020, including a particularly 
                    dramatic increase in middle-income societies and developing countries. Meanwhile, data from 
                    the World Health Organization identify hypertension as the number one cause of mortality in the
                     world and point to its major role in the global burden of disease. For these reasons, 
                     hypertension has become a major issue in the health care agenda of many countries as well as an 
                     increasingly intense focus of interest in the medical community. To illustrate this focus, the 
                     paper on the 2003 European Society of Hypertension - European Society of Cardiology Guidelines 
                     for hypertension published in the Journal of Hypertension was in recent years the fifth most 
                     frequently quoted scientific article of all scientific disciplines combined. The ever-increasing 
                     wealth of information on the basic, pathophysiological and clinical aspects of hypertension 
                     requires a high level of continuing education, prompting physicians and investigators alike to 
                     research the Internet frequently and peruse the many (currently more than 20) scientific journals 
                     dealing specifically with hypertension.

                <h2>Gender differences in hypertension awareness</h2>
                <p>Women were more likely to have their blood pressure measured (76% vs. males 71%, p < 0.001) 
                    and to be ‘aware’ about their own high BP (55% vs. males 43%, p < 0.001). No gender 
                    difference was observed in antihypertensive medication use among those who were aware 
                    of their own high BP (females 67%, males 65%, p = 0.39). Non-working females were less 
                    likely to use antihypertensive (67% vs. non-working males 77%, p < 0.05). Poor women were 
                    worse off compared with poor males in antihypertensive medication use. One-in-three 
                    antihypertensive medication users had stage 2 hypertension (SBP ≥160/DBP ≥100 mmHg). 
                    Female sex, older age, increased wealth, higher BMI and certain geographical regions 
                    were associated with poor blood pressure control among antihypertensive medication users.

                <h2>Smoking and Hypertension</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Elevated blood pressure and tobacco smoking are, respectively, the first and second 
                    leading causes of preventable mortality worldwide. Hence, from both a population 
                    perspective and a patient perspective, the joint occurrence of tobacco smoking and 
                    elevated blood pressure has enormous health consequences.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Worldwide, the absolute number of tobacco smokers has increased because of population 
                    growth, despite a decrease in the age-adjusted prevalence of smoking. 
                    In the United States, the estimated number of tobacco smokers has dropped, as a result 
                    of tobacco-control efforts, from 45.1 million smokers in 2005 to 36.5 million smokers 
                    in 2017 [5]. However, while use of tobacco products has decreased, use of electronic 
                    cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has increased substantially in the United States, along with 
                    concerns about their potential health risks [6]. Water pipe (hookah) smoking is also 
                    common, especially in some Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and Western European countries, 
                    and to a lesser extent in the United States and Canada.
                    The effects of tobacco smoking on blood pressure are complex, with evidence that 
                    tobacco smoking increases blood pressure acutely and increases the risk of 
                    renovascular, malignant, and masked hypertension.
